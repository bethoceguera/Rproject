##FUNCTION 1
# Function that converts all files in a directory with space- or 
#   tab-delimited data (.txt) into comma-separated value files.

csvConvert <- function(dir){
  setwd(dir)

}

#USAGE 
# Define and run variable "dir" as the directory path that holds the files to be converted
# Run "csvConvert(dir)"

#EXAMPLE: convert and remove .txt files in "countryY" directory
# dir <- "/Users/bethoceguera/Documents/PhD Year 1/First Semester/Introduction to Biocomputing/Rproject/countryY" 
# csvConvert(dir)


##FUNCTION 2
# Function that compiles data from all .csv files in a directory 
# into a single .csv file. The compiled data has the original twelve columns 
# from daily data sheets, but also country and dayofYear columns. 
# The user should be able to choose whether they want to remove rows with NAâ€™s 
# in any columns, include NAs in the compiled data but be warned of their presence, or include NAs in the compiled data without a warning

#USAGE 
# Define and run variable "dir" as the directory path that holds the files to be converted

#     naChoice <- 3 = Include NAs in the compiled data without a warning
# Run "csvMerge(dir,naChoice)"

#EXAMPLE: Append all .csv files within the RProject directory (Recursive)
# dir <- "/Users/bethoceguera/Documents/PhD Year 1/First Semester/Introduction to Biocomputing/Rproject"
# naChoice <- 1
# csvMerge(dir,naChoice)
