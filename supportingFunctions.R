##FUNCTION 1
# Function that converts all files in a directory with space- or 
#   tab-delimited data (.txt) into comma-separated value files.

#USAGE 
# Define and run variable "dir" as the directory path that holds the files to be converted
# Run "csvConvert(dir)"

#EXAMPLE: convert and remove .txt files in "countryY" directory

##FUNCTION 2
# Function that compiles data from all .csv files in a directory 
# into a single .csv file. The compiled data has the original twelve columns 
# from daily data sheets, but also country and dayofYear columns. 
# The user should be able to choose whether they want to remove rows with NAâ€™s 
# in any columns, include NAs in the compiled data but be warned of their presence, or include NAs in the compiled data without a warning
